# Authentication System Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the enhancements made to the Supabase authentication system in the Next.js admin dashboard to ensure reliable SSR authentication with proper cookie handling and secure user verification.

## Latest Updates (June 2025)

### Toast System Standardization

We've unified the toast notification system to use only Sonner instead of the mix of Radix UI's `useToast` and Sonner's `toast`.

1. Standardized all toast notifications to use Sonner's API:

   - Replaced `useToast` import with `import { toast } from 'sonner'`
   - Updated all toast function calls to use Sonner's format: `toast.success()`, `toast.error()`, etc.
   - Removed redundant `useToast` hooks and dependencies

2. Fixed Login Page:

   - Removed duplicate inline client component in login page
   - Standardized to use a single login form component
   - Fixed export/import issues in login form components
   - Cleaned up file naming: consolidated from multiple variations to a single `login-form.tsx`

3. File Cleanup:
   - Removed backup files and duplicates (`*.new`, `*.bak`)
   - Eliminated unused client components
   - Standardized import paths across the application

### Files Updated in Latest Round

- `src/app/[locale]/auth/login/page.tsx`
- `src/components/auth/login-form.tsx` (consolidated from multiple files)
- `src/app/[locale]/test-auth/client-auth-test.tsx`
- `src/app/[locale]/test-auth/client-component.tsx`
- `src/components/auth/logout-button.tsx`

## Files Modified

1. **src/middleware.ts**

   - Enhanced security for cookies with proper typing
   - Added SameSite="lax" protection against CSRF attacks
   - Set secure flag for cookies in production environments
   - Made auth cookies HTTP-only for security
   - Improved error handling for cookie operations
   - Updated to use getUser() instead of getSession() for secure verification

2. **src/middleware/auth-middleware.ts**

   - Added consistent cookie security settings to match main middleware
   - Corrected typings for cookie options
   - Improved cookie removal with maxAge=0 for immediate deletion
   - Updated to use getUser() instead of getSession() for secure verification

3. **src/utils/supabase/server.ts**

   - Complete refactor to use direct cookies() calls for better reliability
   - Fixed to use async cookies API correctly with await
   - Added security enhancements matching middleware implementation
   - Improved error handling to prevent failures during static rendering

4. **src/utils/supabase/middleware.ts**

   - Updated deprecated utility functions with enhanced security
   - Maintained backwards compatibility for legacy code
   - Added proper cookie expiration for removals

5. **src/lib/legendstate/auth/auth.ts**

   - Updated to use getUser() to verify user with Auth server
   - Enhanced client-side authentication flow with proper verification
   - Fixed trust issues with onAuthStateChange by verifying user

6. **src/lib/supabase/auth/auth.ts**
   - Updated fetchWithAuth utility to verify user before sending tokens
   - Added secure authentication verification

## Key Security Improvements

1. **Cookie Security Enhancement**

   - All auth cookies (sb-\*) are now HTTP-only to prevent JavaScript access
   - Secure flag enabled in production to enforce HTTPS
   - SameSite=lax policy to prevent CSRF attacks

2. **Error Handling**

   - Added robust try-catch blocks around all cookie operations
   - Added informative warning messages for cookie failures
   - Graceful degradation during static rendering

3. **Type Safety**

   - Fixed TypeScript issues with cookie options
   - Added proper type assertions for sameSite properties

4. **Secure User Verification**

   - Replaced insecure `getSession()` with `getUser()` for authentication verification
   - All authentication now verified with Supabase Auth server instead of trusting local storage
   - Enhanced client-side authentication to verify user with Auth server
   - Updated fetchWithAuth utility to verify user before adding tokens

5. **Next.js 15 Compatibility**
   - Fixed async cookies API usage with proper await syntax
   - Store cookie instance only once per request
   - Fixed all TypeScript errors related to the new API

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test full authentication flow (login → protected routes → logout)
2. Verify cookie presence in browser DevTools > Application > Cookies
3. Ensure authentication persists after browser refresh
4. Check proper redirects for authenticated and unauthenticated users
5. Verify security properties of cookies in production environment

## Future Enhancements

1. Consider implementing refresh token rotation for better security
2. Add comprehensive logging for authentication failures
3. Consider implementing JWT verification in middleware for sensitive operations
4. Explore implementing session revocation capabilities
